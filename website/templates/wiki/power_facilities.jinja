<div class="flex-row huge title">Wiki - Power Facilities</div>

<div class="medium margin-large">

  <p>
    Power facilities are integral for electricity generation within the game. Upon starting, you begin with a single
    steam engine. Initially, only the steam engine, watermill, and windmill are available. However, researching
    <a href="{{ url_for('wiki.render_template_wiki', template_name='technologies') }}">technologies</a> will unlock additional power facilities.
  </p>
  <p>
    Power facilities within Energetica are classified into five categories, each offering different
    characteristics and functionalities.
  </p>
  <h3>Fossil Fuel Family</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Steam Engine</li>
    <li>Coal Burner &ensp;<span class="txt_pine">(Coal)</span></li>
    <li>Gas Burner &ensp;<span class="txt_pine">(Gas)</span></li>
    <li>Combined Cycle &ensp;<span class="txt_pine">(Gas + Coal)</span></li>
    <li>Nuclear Reactor &ensp;<span class="txt_pine">(Uranium)</span></li>
    <li>Gen4 Nuclear &ensp;<span class="txt_pine">(Uranium)</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p>These facilities are controllable, emit CO<sub>2</sub>, and require fuel for operation (except for the steam engine).</p>
  <h3>Wind Family</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Windmill</li>
    <li>Onshore Wind Turbine</li>
    <li>Offshore Wind Turbine</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These facilities are non-controllable, do not emit pollutants during operation, and their power output varies based 
    on wind conditions.
  </p>
  <h3>Hydro Family</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Watermill</li>
    <li>Small Water Dam</li>
    <li>Large Water Dam</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Similar to wind facilities, these are non-controllable, emission-free during operation, and their output varies 
    during the year based on river discharge rates.
  </p>
  <h3>Solar Family</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Concentrated Solar Power</li>
    <li>Photovoltaics</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    These facilities are also non-controllable, emission-free during operation, and their output varies based on solar 
    irradiance levels.
  </p>
  <h2 id="Power_Generation_of_Renewable_Facilities">Power Generation of Renewable Facilities</h2>
  <p>
    Renewable power generation is non-controllable, meaning their power output is determined by specific calculations,
    regardless of the demand. Any surplus generation needs to be either stored or dumped.
  </p>

  <h3 id="Solar_Power_Generation">Solar Power Generation</h3>
  <p>
    The power generation of solar facilities is influenced by the irradiance level at the facilities location. The 
    irradiance is variable in time and space so different instance of a facility might generate different amounts of
    electricity. The irradiance at the center of the player's tile is visible on the 
    <a href="/home">Dashboard</a>. For more information about the weather simulation, see 
    <a href="{{ url_for('wiki.render_template_wiki', template_name='time_and_weather', _anchor='solar_irradiance') }}">Solar Irradiance</a>.
  </p>
  <p>The formula for total power generation of solar facilties:</p>
  <ul style="list-style: none;"><li>
    <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right padding"></i>\(P_s(t) = \sum_{n} \frac{ irr_{n}(t) }{1000W/m²} \times P_{max,n} \)<br>
    where \(irr_{n}\) is the current irradiance at the loaction of facility \(n\) in W/m², 
    \(1000 W/m²\) is the maximal irradiance and \(P_{max,n}\) is the max power generation of the
    facility \(n\).
  </li></ul>

  <h3 id="Wind_Power_Generation">Wind Power Generation</h3>
  <p>
    The power production of wind facilities is influenced by the current wind speed at the facility's location. The wind
    speed is variable in time and space so different instances of a facility might generate different amounts of 
    electricity. The wind speed at the center of the player's tile is visible on the <a href="/home">Dashboard</a>.
    For more information about the weather simulation, see 
    <a href="{{ url_for('wiki.render_template_wiki', template_name='time_and_weather', _anchor='wind_speed') }}">Wind Speed</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition to this, each wind speed instance has an attributed wind speed multiplier that represents the exposure 
    of the location to wind. The more wind facilities a player builds, the less efficient they will be. See 
    <a href="{{ url_for('wiki.render_template_wiki', template_name='map', _anchor='wind_potential') }}">Wind Potential</a> 
    for more details. 
  </p>
  <p>
    The power production of a wind facility is calculated using a characteristic function:
  </p>
  <div class="graph-container">
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/wiki/char_func_wind.jpg') }}"
         alt="Characteristic curve of wind turbine">
  </div>
  <p>The formula for the power generation at time t of all wind facilities is:</p>
  <ul style="list-style: none;"><li>
    <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right padding"></i>\(P_w(t) = \sum_{n} cf(ws_{n}(t)) \times P_{max,n} \)<br>
    where \(cf()\) is the characteristic function shown in the graph above, \(ws_{n}\) the current wind speed for the 
    specific instance \(n\) (see 
    <a href="{{ url_for('wiki.render_template_wiki', template_name='map', _anchor='wind_potential') }}">Wind Potential</a>) 
    and \(P_{max,n}\) is the max power generation of the facility.
  </li></ul>
  
  <h3 id="Hydro_Power_Generation">Hydropower Generation</h3>
  <p>
    Hydropower generation fluctuates with the change in river discharge rates, following seasonal patterns within the
    game's timeline.
  </p>
  <div class="graph-container">
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/wiki/seasonal_variation_rivers.jpg') }}"
         alt="Seasonal variataions of river discharges"
         id="seasonal_variation_rivers_graph">
  </div>
  <p>Formula for total power generation of hydropower facilty type i:</p>
  <ul style="list-style: none;"><li>
    <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right padding"></i>\(P_h(t) = \sum_{n} sv(t) \times P_{max,n} \)<br>
    where \(sv\) is the seasonal variation shown in the graph, \(t\) is the in-game date 
    (<a href="{{ url_for('wiki.render_template_wiki', template_name='time_and_weather', _anchor='game_time') }}">
    1 in-game year = {{(engine.clock_time / engine.in_game_seconds_per_tick * 72) | round() | int }} real-time days</a>) 
    and \(P_{max,n}\) is the max power generation of the facility instance n.
  </li></ul>
  <p>
    Note that the building and operational costs of hydro facilities increase with each new instance, reflecting the 
    difficulty of constructing in increasingly hard-to-access locations. See 
    <a href="{{ url_for('wiki.render_template_wiki', template_name='map', _anchor='hydro_potential') }}">
    Hydro Potential</a> for more information.
  </p>

  <h2 id="Power_Generation_of_Controllable_Plants">Power Generation of Controllable Facilities</h2>
  <p>
    Controllable facility power generation must adhere to the ramping constraints of each facility from one game tick to the
    next. The ramping speed, expressed in W/min, applies both to ramping up and down.
  </p>
  <p>
    For instance, a controllable facility with a ramping speed of 10 kW/min, generating 100 kW, can vary its output
    between 90 and 110 kW in the following minute (<a href="{{ url_for('wiki.render_template_wiki', template_name='time_and_weather', _anchor='game_time') }}">in-game time</a>). 
    Unused minimal power may need to be dumped to satisfy the ramping down constraint.
  </p>
  <p>
    The order of priority in which the controllable facilities are used can be adjusted by the player. See 
    <a href="{{ url_for('wiki.render_template_wiki', template_name='power_management') }}">Power management</a> for details.
  </p>
  <h3>Use of Resources</h3>
  <p>Except for the steam engine, controllable power facilities consume resources (fuel) for operation.</p>
  <p>
    The fuel usage is measured in kg/MWh, indicating that fuel consumption is proportionate to the electricity
    generated. In cases where a facility lacks sufficient fuel to produce a specific amount of electricity, it will cap its
    maximal production according to the available fuel stocks.
  </p>
  <p>
    {% if "Unlock Technologies" in user.achievements %}<a href="{{ url_for('views.technology', _anchor='Thermodynamics') }}">
    Thermodynamics</a>{% else %}Thermodynamics{% endif %} 
    influences facility efficiency, decreasing fuel consumption per unit of energy.
  </p>
  <h3>CO<sub>2</sub> Emissions</h3>
  <p>
    CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are calculated based on the fuel usage of a facility and are expressed in kg/MWh. Similar to fuel
    consumption, CO<sub>2</sub> production correlates with the amount of power generated. CO<sub>2</sub> emissions affect the shared
    atmosphere among all players, influencing the game's climate. Refer to 
    <a href="{{ url_for('wiki.render_template_wiki', template_name='climate_effects') }}">Climate Change</a> for more details.
  </p>
  <h2 id="O&M_costs">Operation and Maintenance Cost</h2>
  <p>
    Each power facility in the game incurs operational and maintenance costs. For renewable facilities, these costs are
    fixed, while for controllable facilities, there is both a fixed and a variable component. The fixed costs represent 20%
    of the total O&M costs, while the variable costs, dependent on the power output of the facility, constitute the 
    remaining 80%. Nuclear facilities, such as the Nuclear Reactor and Gen4 Nuclear, differ in that they have a fixed 
    cost fraction of 50%. The O&M costs provided for each facility in the power facilities page are based on 100% power 
    output.
  </p>
  <h2 id="Construction_of_a_Plant">Construction of a Facility</h2>
  <p>If you choose to build a new facility, it will require various resources:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Price: The cost to initiate construction</li>
    <li>Duration: The time required for completion</li>
    <li>Power consumption: Power required during construction</li>
    <li>Emissions: CO<sub>2</sub> emitted during construction, distributed over the construction period</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Construction projects are undertaken by construction workers. Each worker can focus on a single construction at a 
    time. Construction projects can be paused, cancelled, and reordered. If a construction is immediately cancelled, 80% 
    of the facility's price will be refunded, with a proportionaly decreasing refund as construction progresses. Upon completing a 
    construction, a worker will automatically move on to the next project in the list, if possible.
  </p>
  <p>If the energy demand for constructions isn't met, it is paused, except for the initial phase, during which a ramping up period is allowed. 
  During this period, it's acceptable for the satisfaction level to be lower as long as the power consumption increases by at least 5% per minute.</p>
  <p>
    Researching {% if "Unlock Technologies" in user.achievements %}<a href="{{ url_for('views.technology', _anchor='Building Technology') }}">
    building technology</a>{% else %}building technology{% endif %} will unlock additional construction workers and 
    increase the speed of construction projects.
  </p>
  <p>
    When a facility is buit, a random location inside the player's tile is assigned to it. This is especially important 
    for wind and solar facilities, as their output is influenced by the weather conditions at their location.
  </p>

  <h3>Lifespan of a Facility</h3>
  <p>
    Each facility has an operational lifespan. At the end of its lifespan, a facility is automatically decommisionned 
    at a cost equivalent to 20% of its original price.
  </p>
  <p>
    It is also possible to dismantle a facility before the end of its lifespan. This can be done in the 
    <a href="/profile">Profile page</a> and happens instantly. The dismantling process has the same cost as decomissioning.
  </p>

  <h3>Upgrades</h3>
  <p>
    When a new technology research is completed that affects the characteristics of certain facilities, the effect do 
    not automatically apply to instances of the facilities that are under construction or already built. Players must 
    individually upgrade these facilities through the <a href="/profile">Profile page</a>. The upgrade cost is 
    determined as the maximum value between 5% of the initial facility cost and the price difference associated with 
    the new upgrade. This upgrade process is instantaneous.
  </p>
