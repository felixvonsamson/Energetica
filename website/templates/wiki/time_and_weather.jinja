  <h2 id="game_time">Game Time</h2>

  <p>
    The game operates on a clock that updates every {{ engine.clock_time }} seconds, referred to as a "tick". This means 
    the game values are updated every {{ engine.clock_time }} seconds.
  </p>
  <p>
    To enhance the gaming experience, game time is significantly faster than real-time. There are 
    {{ (engine.in_game_seconds_per_tick / engine.clock_time) | round() | int }} in-game days in a real-time day and an 
    in-game year has only 72 in-game days. The following table shows the conversion between ticks, in-game time, and 
    real-time:
  </p>
  <div class="flex-center align-items-center">
    <table class="table bone txt_center">
        <tr>
          <th>Real Time</th>
          <th>In-game Time</th>
          <th>Game Ticks</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>

    All durations in the game are given in in-game time and in some cases the equivalent real time might be indicated in parenthesis

  <h2 id="in_game_weather">Weather Simulation</h2>

  <p>
    The current in-game weather conditions, consisting of solar iradiance, wind speed and river discharge rates are 
    displayed on the <a href="{{ url_for('views.home') }}">Dashboard</a>. The weather is simulated with the intention of 
    providing a realistic representation of the real weather conditions. 
  </p>

  <h3 id="solar_irradiance">Solar Irradiance</h3>

  <p>
    The solar irradiance is used to calculate the electricity production of 
    <a href="{{ url_for('wiki.render_template_wiki', template_name='power_facilities', _anchor='Solar_Power_Generation') }}">solar power facilities</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Solar irradiance is the power per unit area received from the sun and is measured in watts per square meter (W/m²). 
    The solar irradiance is influenced by the time of day, the season, the geographical location and the cloud coverage 
    of the sky. The seasonal, diurnal and geographical influence can be modelled with a clear sky irradiance model,
    however the cloud coverage is much more stochastic. The game generates a three dimentional perlin noise moving in 
    time to simulate the moving clouds with some regions with high cloud coverage and some with low or no cloud coverage.
    The following image shows how this cloud coverage over the map looks like.
  </p>

  <div class="graph-container">
    <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/wiki/cloud_coverage.png') }}"
         alt="Cloud coverage of the sky">
  </div>

  <p>
    When a facility is built, a random location inside the player's tile is attributed to the facility. This means that 
    each solar power facility has a different solar irradiance value.
  </p>

  <h3 id="wind_speed">Wind Speed</h3>

  <p>
    The wind speed is used to calculate the electricity production of 
    <a href="{{ url_for('wiki.render_template_wiki', template_name='power_facilities', _anchor='Wind_Power_Generation') }}">wind power facilities</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The wind speed is given in kilometers per hour (km/h) and varies with different frequencies. In the game it is 
    modelled with a tree dimentional perlin noise superposed with a sinusoidal function to simulate the daily and 
    seasonal variations. In general the wind is stronger during the night and in winter than during the day and in 
    summer but the exact values are random and vary from one location to another.
  </p>

  <h3 id="river_discharge">River Discharge</h3>

  <p>
    The river discharge is used to calculate the electricity production of 
    <a href="{{ url_for('wiki.render_template_wiki', template_name='power_facilities', _anchor='Hydro_Power_Generation') }}">hydropower facilities</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The river discharge is given in cubic meters per second (m³/s) and varies seasonally (see 
    <a href="{{ url_for('wiki.render_template_wiki', template_name='power_facilities', _anchor='seasonal_variation_rivers_graph') }}">figure</a>).
